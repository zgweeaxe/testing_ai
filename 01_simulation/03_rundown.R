# Step 1: Data Generation (Simulation)
# Simulate patient population data
set.seed(123)
num_patients <- 1000

# Generate synthetic patient data
patient_data <- data.frame(
  Patient_ID = 1:num_patients,
  Age = sample(18:80, num_patients, replace = TRUE),
  Gender = sample(c("Male", "Female"), num_patients, replace = TRUE),
  Baseline_Severity = rnorm(num_patients, mean = 3, sd = 1),
  Comorbidities = sample(0:4, num_patients, replace = TRUE),
  Initial_Treatment = sample(c("Treatment A", "Treatment B", "Treatment C"), num_patients, replace = TRUE)
)

# Simulate disease progression data
disease_data <- data.frame()

for (patient_id in 1:num_patients) {

}

colnames(disease_data) <- c("Patient_ID", "Time_Point", "Health_State", "Treatment_Response")

# Define health state utilities and costs (AI-enhanced parameters)
health_state_utilities <- c(0.9, 0.7, 0.8)  # Utilities for "Stable," "Improved," "Worsened"

# Step 2: Model Architecture (R Shiny Application)

  # Define input elements for user interaction (e.g., sliders, selectInput)
  sidebarLayout(
    sidebarPanel(
      # User input elements go here
    ),
    mainPanel(
      # Output elements (e.g., plots, tables) for displaying results
      dataTableOutput("cost_effectiveness_table")
    )
  )
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
  observe({
    # Implement the cost-effectiveness model using simulated data and AI-enhanced parameters
    # Retrieve user input (if any) for scenarios or settings
    
    # Calculate cost-effectiveness metrics (e.g., ICER)
    
    # Display results in the main panel
    output$cost_effectiveness_table <- renderDataTable({
      # Display cost-effectiveness results here
      # Include AI-enhanced parameters, user-adjustable scenarios, and outcomes
    })
  })
}

shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)

# Step 7: Performance Evaluation and Validation (Not shown in this script)
# This step typically involves comparing model outputs with real-world data and conducting sensitivity analyses.
# Performance metrics, such as model fit and calibration, should be evaluated.

# Note: The performance evaluation and validation step may require additional data and statistical analyses.
