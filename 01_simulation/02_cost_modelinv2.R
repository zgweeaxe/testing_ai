# Task 1: Choose an Appropriate Modeling Approach (Markov Modeling)

# In a Markov model, we define health states and transitions between them over discrete time intervals.
# For simplicity, we'll consider two health states: "Stable" and "Worsened."

# Define Markov model parameters (transition probabilities)
transition_matrix <- matrix(c(
  0.9, 0.1,  # Transition probability from "Stable" to "Stable" and "Worsened"
  0.2, 0.8   # Transition probability from "Worsened" to "Stable" and "Worsened"
), nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE)

# Define health state utilities and costs
health_state_utilities <- c(0.9, 0.7)  # Utility values for "Stable" and "Worsened" health states
health_state_costs <- c(1000, 2000)    # Cost values for "Stable" and "Worsened" health states

  # Define input elements (e.g., sliders, selectInput) for user interaction

    sidebarPanel(
      # User input elements go here

      # Output elements (e.g., plots, tables) for displaying results
      dataTableOutput("cost_effectiveness_table")

    # Return cost-effectiveness results
    data.frame(Health_State = health_state, Total_Cost = total_cost, QALYs = qalys, ICER = icer)
